# Earnings-Dates
Get historical dates of earning announcements, EPS estimates, and actual EPS from Yahoo Finance. Run `python xearnings_bulk.py` to create `earnings_dates_all.csv`. `itot_tickers_20260115.txt` has the symbols of the stocks owned by the iShares Core S&P Total US Stock Market ETF (ITOT) as of 2026-01-15. It takes about 3s per stock to get data for quarterly earnings from 2002 through 2025.

The script `xsummarize_earnings.py` reads the CSV data file created by `xearnings_bulk.py` and summarizes the data by stock, creating `earnings_summary.csv`, which has the # of earnings dates, the first and last earnings dates, the median, mean, and standard deviation of earnings surprises, the # of positive and negative earnings surprises, the CAGR of EPS, and the median, min, and max # of days between earnings dates. For almost all stocks the median # of days between earnings dates is close to 90, since companies report earnings quarterly in the U.S. In many case the min days between earnings dates is much smaller than this. I don't know if these cases correspond to earnings restatements or data errors.

The script `xannual_earnings.py` also reads the CSV data file created by `xearnings_bulk.py` and creates `annual_earnings.csv`, which summarizes the data by stock and year, showing actual and estimated EPS by quarter. If the # of earnings dates in a year exceeds 4, that could indicate an earnings restatement or data error.
